#This is a special file which will tell the python that this directory is a python package
#The code inside this file runs automatically when we import the package

#There are number of packages tailored for specific tasks that are
#developed and maintained by active python community 
#While working on larger projects we need to make use of these packages
#rather building evrything from scratch
#For example, while working with web development we probably need to use Django or flask at some point
#To use these packages, we need to first install them
#This is where pip comes into the picture
#pip is a standard package manager for python 
#that helps to install and manage additional packages that are not available in standard python library
